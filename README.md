###Creating an Augmented Reality Environment to Teach Kids Coding Concepts

###Overview
Currently, the traditional methods of learning the problem-solving skills 
involved in computer science can prove to be confusing and non-intuitive to young
children, therefore detracting them from getting involved in CS. Augmented Reality 
using the Microsoft HoloLens can be used to create an engaging environment and
immerse children. My project is to create an Augmented Reality HoloLens 
application that teaches children how to start using their problem solving 
skills and think like a programmer, while immersing them in a fun environment so
children become more interested in the CS field.
